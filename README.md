# Tinderly

Tinderly is a frontend web application built with React and Vite that provides a modern dating style profile discovery experience.

It offers a Tinder inspired swipe style interface where users can sign up or sign in using Firebase Authentication, access protected Feed and Profile pages, discover profiles in a smooth animated card feed, interact using accept and reject actions, and update their details through a Profile Settings form, with session state managed using Redux and the UI styled using Tailwind CSS.
